Create a simple web application which will use Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/">Account Kit</a> user authentication.

Why we are asking you to do this: We believe that code is poetry. This short, simple test will help you demonstrate not just your programming talent, but your approach to designing an application. We donâ€™t just want to see the coder in you - we want to see the engineer and a great startup developer.

***Plan well*** - The goal here is not to finish the task as quickly as possible, but to demonstrate your careful thinking and planning.

***Write for the future*** - Write your code as if someone else will be working with it the next day. That person should be able to hit the ground running immediately.

***Keep dependencies to a minimum*** - Importing a facebook JS would be sensible for this task, but using a full-featured web framework would probably be overkill.

***Publicly accessible*** - Present the solution as a publicly accessible URL
